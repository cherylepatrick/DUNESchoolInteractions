# DUNESchoolInteractions
Exercises for my first interactions activity at the DUNE summer school 2021, adapted to run on the Edinburgh machines

- Example1.C - Draws the nu_mu flux
- Exercise1.C - Flux exercise
- Exercise2.C,  Exercise2a.C - Quasi-elastic interactions
- Exercise3.C - Various quasi-elastic reconstruction methods

The files with Solution in the name should run in CAFAna. To run them, once you've set up CAFAna, type (e.g.) cafe Exercise1Solution.C

The ones without Solution won't run until you fix them!

These are designed to be used with the DUNE Interactions School worksheet.
