# DUNESchoolInteractions
Exercises for my first interactions activity at the DUNE summer school 2021

- Example1.C - Draws the nu_mu flux
- Exercise1.C - Flux exercise
- Exercise2.C,  Exercise2a.C - Quasi-elastic interactions
- Exercise3.C - Various quasi-elastic reconstruction methods

The files with Solution in the name should run in CAFAna. To run them, once you've set up CAFAna, type (e.g.) cafe Exercise1Solution.C

The ones without Solution won't run until you fix them!

These are designed to be used with the worksheet from the DUNE neutrino-interactions summer school, "My first neutrino interaction analysis" session. See the indico page at https://indico.fnal.gov/event/48900/overview for details and to download the worksheet. There are also introductory slides. You'll need DUNE access and an installation of CAFAna on the DUNE gpvm's - see the requirements page on the indico for instructions. While I also made this available for GENIE, these are the files for DUNE (for GENIE I just copied across some CAFs to /genie/app/users/cpatrick/DUNESchool/CAFs/ but I don't promise they will stay there forever.)
